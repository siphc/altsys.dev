Undergraduate student studying Computer Science at the Henry Samueli School of Engineering at UCLA. Passionate about Embedded Systems, Operating Systems (Linux), Low-level engineering with C/C++, Compiler Optimization, FPGAs, Open Source Development, Digital Rights, and writing fast, reliable code that does not suck.

I am always looking for opportunities to learn, and I believe that the best way to do so is to talk to another person who is deeply interested in a subject. If you want to chat with me, you can find my contact information on this site (LLM generated emails will be ignored).
